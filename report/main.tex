This report was commisioned to describe the design and implementation of a National Integration Platform (NIP) prototype
for Citizen Centric eHealth in Norway. Recent years have seen a strong momentum to the development of large-scale eHealth solutions
to the benefit of healthcare systems and thus citizens. Some examples include ePrescriptions and the web-portal \textit{helsenorge}
for citezen centric health. In future years, eHealth will definitely have a key role in making healthcare systems more
efficient, interoperable and ubiquitous. However national eHealth projects have a high degree of complexity given
their criticality and scale.

The purpose of this work is to study how national eHealth project can leverage the dynamics of the market
and consumers behaviour by taking advantage of electronic devices such as smartphones and tables.
These devices are becoming more and more widespread and cheap and can already be
used to monitor users' health using a number of third-party developed applications.

This document examines a number of already existing similar or related solutions and platforms.
The proposed solution consists of a RESTful web application programming interface to transfer JSON data models representing
health parameters such as heart rate or weight. A number of Android applications and a web portal have been developed
to study the feasibility of practical use of such RESTful API as an integration platform to gather data from
various sources like Android applications or already existing third party solutions like Microsoft HealthVault.

The perspective which we analyze is twofold: on one side we are interested in the feasibility of such integration
platform using the chosen approach. We briefly discuss its scalability both in terms of effort required to support
more data models and hardware requirements. On the other side we examine the practical scenario from a third party
developer perspective by taking into consideration the amount of effort required to implement basic interoperability
functionality into an Android application.

%A NIP is a platform to collect different user generated eHealth data from third party solutions and services.
%It also describes the making of the working prototype.
%The challenges of this prototype is to demonstrate the transfer of personal and/or medical data from different devices and systems.
%The intention of the platform is to enable citizens the ability to publish information they produce into the government run NIP. 

% emanuele - it is indeed worth noting, but not in the abstract.
%It is worth noting that security is not a requirement of the prototype.

%To demonstrate these different parts the creation of an Android application (App), a web App and a back-end Application Programming Interface (API) was required. 

%The motivation for working in this project is to innovate and create a new platform that can be used to better understand the health of citizens. 
%The citizens gather various health data from different locations and devices and in return provide a better understanding of the citizens health. 
%Together with educated health professionals and doctors this can be a powerful tool for improving the quality of life of the users. 
%The most interesting part was to figure out how to design a system that can have the high level of security required to transfer personal health information. 

%The demands were to plan, design and describe the NIP and to develop a prototype. 
%The demonstration of this product is aimed mainly at two groups of people: \\
%1. Educated health professionals \\
%2. Developers \\
%The product should have a demonstration side that is easy for the first group to grasp, understand and form an idea of how it will work while also making it appealing and technical for the second group. 

%The result of this project is first and foremost a working prototype of a NIP. 
%It is also a web App and an Android app to make the demonstration easier to grasp. 
%This report is also part of the result which has the purpose of documenting the problem, the process, the workflow and the final products.

%The project was executed on behalf of Helsedirektoratet or The Norwegian Directorate of Health.
The team consisted of three students from NTNU.

The team would like to thank Meng Zhu for his advices and supervision and the customer
representative Mr. Helge T. Blindheim for his availability.

%Thank the people from usability/design tests valuable feedback?
