Week 35 \\*
Dates 2013-08-26 - 2013-09-01 \\*
TDT4290 Customer Driven Project - Group 17
\end{center}

\textbf{1. Work done}

This week was mostly focused on initial planning of the project.
This included but was not limited to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Internal meeting planning
\item Customer meeting planning
\item Iteration planning
\item Milestone planning
\item Preliminary studies
\end{itemize}


The team agreed the following weekly meetings:
\begin{itemize}
\item On Mondays from 10 to 19
\item On Wednesdays from 15 to 19
\end{itemize}

Each team member agreed to work another 8 hours per week by himself.

The team worked on a preliminary system architecture that was submitted
to the Customer in order to make clear to him our understanding of the project goal. The Customer was then contacted on Monday the 26th through Skype and provided positive feedback.

The Customer and the team agreed on when to have the next meetings.

A Google Drive folder was created in order to share and collaborate in creating and editing documents. 
The Customer has also access to this folder and has already used it to have a look at the preliminary system architecture.

The team also planned iterations (their number, duration and focus) and milestones for the project and initiated preliminary studies on relevant technologies.

The team chose a LaTex template for the report.


\textbf{1.2 Meetings}

\textbf{2. Plan for next week}

Based on the feedback received from our Customer, we have identified the scope of the project and will conduct studies on relevant technologies in the project’s domain. We will try to identify some formal requirements
for the system, or rather parts of it, based on some use cases and proceed to plan the work for the next iteration.

\end{table}


\textbf{3. Milestones}

Milestones reached: none.

\textbf{4. Problems}

The team is still unsure about the commitment of its fourth member
who still has to show up. Furthermore the timetable for the course
is not clear and inconsistent between sources.

Dates 2013-09-02 - 2013-09-08 \\*
TDT4290 Customer Driven Project - Group 17
\end{center}

\textbf{1. Work done}

The team studied relevant existing solutions and technologies.
In particular, among the ones we took into consideration there is an integration platform suggested by the customer himself.

The team set-up the working environments and other tools such as:
\begin{itemize}
\item LaTeX environments for writing the report
\item a server machine for product deployment
\item a git repository managed with GitHub
\item Apache Tomcat web server
\item Android’s SDK
\item IDEs
\end{itemize}

During the Skype meeting, the customer mentioned Microsoft’s  HealthVault and expressed his wish to see it supported by the integration platform (the product).

The team developed a prototype Android application to monitor the user’s heart rate. An assessment of the risks for this project was performed and will be updated weekly or once per iteration.

\textbf{1.2 Meetings}

Monday
from 10 to 19, all members present.
Skype call with the customer, meeting with the supervisor.

Wednesday
from 15 to 19, all members present. Emanuele joined two hours late because he had to attend a lecture. 
He had notified the other team members beforehand.

\textbf{2. Plan for next week}

Because team members are not familiar with the technologies involved  additional study is required in order to decide upon system architecture.
Regarding HealthVault, the team still needs to asses the feasibility of supporting such technology in the product. 
For the next iteration the team will start working on an initial system based on the Spring Framework, the Apache Tomcat server and database backend. 
The team will also start working on the report. 
We will produce more use cases and define requirements.

\textbf{3. Milestones}

Milestones reached: none

\textbf{4. Problems}

The customer is not providing us some documents we requested.
These are not critical for the moment.

\textbf{3. Milestones}

Milestones reached: none

\textbf{4. Problems}

Given the size of our group, we expect writing the report will delay our progress with the product itself.

He provided very positive feedback.
In order to help us plan and prioritize our work we asked the Customer about what he’d like us to start working on next. 
The Customer expressed his interest for HealthVault's integration. 
We informed the Customer that during the next iteration we will mostly focus on report work anyway.

Risk analysis has been updated. Milestones have been reviewed based on supervisor’s advice.

The meeting with the customer for the 24th of September was rescheduled by the customer for the 30th. 
During the Skype meeting on Monday, we reported our progress to the customer and told him what would show him next time. 
In an effort to find new requirements that could make the product more valuable for the customer we asked him whether he was interested in a webpage that could be used to demonstrate HealtVault interoperability.
The customer expressed his interest in such a feature, stating that it would be of great value.
As such, being confident of the practicality of such idea and our ability to implement it in a short timeframe we commited to its development.
