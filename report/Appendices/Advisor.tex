Weekly status report
Week 35

Customer Driven Project - Group 17

1. Summary

This week was mostly focused on initial planning of the project.
This included but was not limited to:
Internal meetings planning
Customer meetings planning
Iterations planning
Milestones planning
Preliminary studies

2. Work done

The team planned the following weekly meetings:
On Mondays from 10 to 19
On Wednesdays from 15 to 19

Each team member agreed to work another 8 hours per week by himself.

The team worked on a preliminary system architecture that was submitted
to the Customer in order to make clear to him our understanding of the project goal. The Customer was then contacted on Monday the 26th through Skype and provided positive feedback.

The Customer and the team agreed on when to have the next meetings.

A Google Drive group was created in order to share and collaborate in creating/editing documents. The Customer has access to such group and has already used it to have a look at the preliminary system architecture.

The team also planned iterations (their number, duration and focus) and milestones for the project and initiated preliminary studies on relevant technologies.

The team chose a LaTex template for the report.


2.1 Milestones reached: none.


2.2 Meetings details

Monday
from 10 to 18, all three members present. Skype call with the Customer.
Wednesday
from 15 to 18, all members present except Emanuele who previously notified the other team members.

3 Planning for the next week

Based on the feedback received from our Customer, we have identified the scope of the project and will conduct studies on relevant technologies in the project’s domain. We will try to identify some formal requirements
for the system, or rather parts of it, based on some use cases and proceed to plan the work for the next iteration.

4. Problems

The team is still unsure about the commitment of its fourth member
who still has to show up. Furthermore the timetable for the course
is not clear and inconsistent between sources.

\subsection{Week 36}
Weekly status report
Week 36

Customer Driven Project - Group 17

1. Work done

The team studied relevant existing solutions and technologies.
In particular, among the ones we took into consideration there is an
integration platform suggested by the customer himself.

The team set-up the working environments and other tools such as:
LaTeX environments for writing the report
a server machine for product deployment
a git repository managed with GitHub
Apache Tomcat web server
Android’s SDK
IDEs

During the Skype meeting, the customer mentioned Microsoft’s  HealthVault and expressed his wish to see it supported by the integration platform (the product).

The team developed a prototype Android application to monitor the user’s heart rate. An assessment of the risks for this project was performed and will be updated weekly or once per iteration.

1.1 Milestones reached : none

1.2 Meetings

Monday
from 10 to 19, all members present.
Skype call with the customer, meeting with the supervisor.
Wednesday
from 15 to 19, all members present. Emanuele joined two hours late because he had to attend a lecture. He had notified the other team members beforehand.

2. Planning

Because team members are not familiar with the technologies involved  additional study is required in order to decide upon system architecture.
Regarding HealthVault, the team still needs to asses the feasibility of supporting such technology in the product. For the next iteration the team will start working on an initial system based on the Spring Framework, the Apache Tomcat server and database backend. The team will also start working on the report. We will produce more use cases and define requirements.

3. Problems

The customer is not providing us some documents we requested.
These are not critical for the moment.

Weekly status report
Week 37

Customer Driven Project - Group 17


1. Work done

During this week the team has worked toward an initial implementation of the system. The database server has been installed and configured on the server machine. The team also started working on the API itself and on the portal web-page. A initial set of requirements for part of the system has been identified. Risk analysis has been updated.

1.1 Milestones reached: none

1.2 Meetings

Monday
from 10 to 19, all members present.
Skype call with the customer, meeting with the supervisor.

Wednesday
from 15 to 19, all members present.

2. Planning

Further studies need to be conducted on relevant technologies. The team will meet the customer in person on Friday. We plan to demonstrate some basic system functionality by then. The team should try to get started on the mid-term report as soon as possible.



3. Problems

Given the size of our group, we expect writing the report will delay our progress with the product itself.


\subsection{Week 38}
Weekly status report
Week 38

Customer Driven Project - Group 17


1. Work done

The team has finished developing a first prototype of the system which has been shown to the customer. He provided very positive feedback.
In order to help us plan and prioritize our work we asked the Customer about what he’d like us to start working on next. The Customer expressed his interest for HealthVault's integration. We informed the Customer that during the next iteration we will mostly focus on report work anyway.

Risk analysis has been updated. Milestones have been reviewed based on supervisor’s advice.

1.1 Milestones achieved: M1 First prototype of the system.

An Android application which measures the user’s heart rate and forwards it to the integration platform.
A Spring REST endpoint that handles such data and stores it in a local MySQL database.
A webpage frontend displaying the data using charts.

Associated deliverables: none

1.2 Meetings

Monday from 10 to 19
Emanuele and Sebastian present.
Skype call with the customer, meeting with the supervisor.

Wednesday from 15 to 19
Emanuele and Sebastian present.

Friday from 12.30 to 14.30
Emanuele and Sebastian present, Anders joined on Skype.
Meeting with the Customer in person. Demonstration of the product.

2. Planning

During the next week the team will focus primarily on the report.
We shared our plan for the next iteration with the Customer, as we do regularly. Emanuele will also study HealthVault in order to assess the possibility of its integration in our platform. Because we are confident we can use HealthVault  we have planned some work for its integration as well.

3. Problems

None.
