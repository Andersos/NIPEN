	Application name	& Heart Rate Application \\
	Name				& Heart rate measurement \\
	Requirement			& \hyperref[table:reqheartrate]{FHR1} \\
	Description			& Test the heart rate measurement functionality \\
	Preconditions		& The application has started \\
	Steps 				&	\par 1. User holds his finger on the camera applying a slight pressure \\
	Postconditions		&	\par 1. The icon on the left side of the screen is blinking 
							\par 2. A measurement appears after 4 seconds at most \\
	Results				& The result was a heart measurement of 77, which is accurate.
						  However, the measurement didn't appear until after 6 or 7 seconds.
						  This might be because of wrong finger placement, and may also vary from phone to phone.
						  The measurement was quite accurate and hence the test was successful. \\
	Comments			&	The measurement is expected to be rough.
							Any value between 60 and 100 is okay as long as it actually varies slightly based
							on the tester's perceived heart rate.  \\
	Status				& OK \\
