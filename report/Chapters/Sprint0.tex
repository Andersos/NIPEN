\section{Planning}

** We planned to have 2 weeks sprint but in the middle of the sprint we changed the first sprint to a 3 week sprint. That makes some of our numebrs inconsistent. Refering to the status reports and the weekly meetings. We usually estimated 60 hours per week of work but the first sprint ended up beeing estimated at 200 hours for 3 weeks**
