\lhead{Chapter 17. \emph{Reflection}}

 This is our reflection. 
 This chapter contains information about our experiences throughout this project. 
 It covers what we have learned, what went well and what that could have benn done different. 
 We discuss the group dynamics, the customer relations and the supervisor relations.
 
\section{Group dynamics}
\subsection{Relations}
\subsection{Communication}
facebook, skype
\subsection{Organization}
Project management
 
 
 
\section{Customer relations}
This section covers our relations to the customer
\subsection{Relations}
We worked good with our customer.
Most issues we discussed and caim to an agreement of what we wanted to focus on and accomplish.
Our task was a very open one nad we used some time to figure out a solution all parts could agree on. Ufortunatly we ended up beeing only three people so the task had to be cut back a lot. 
During the project new ideas and directions caim from the customer.
We considerd it our job to do our best to deliver what the customer wanted and changed the direction of our project with that of the customer.
\subsection{Communication}
Our customer was located in Oslo making it difficult to meet in person every week.
We arranged it so we could have a skype meeting with him every week.
Having a meeting via teleconferencing is different than meeting in person.
For our purpuses these type of meetings were sufficient. 

\subsection{The project}
This was a very exiting project to work on. 
Self quantifications is a hot and very current topic in the age of smartphones.
We found it very interesting that our client wanted to explore the idea of analysing qunatifiable data about citizen health.
Developing a platform for this is a huge and massive task but we did our best in outlining our thought and ideas of how to go forth and accomplishe something like this. 

 
 
 
\section{Supervisor relations}
This section convers our relations to the supervisor. 
\subsection{Relations}
The relation with the supervisor was not as extensive as the one with had with the customer.
The supervisor vent through our notes and watched our progress.
He helped us head in the right direction and to figure out what we had to do.
In the beginning we didn't understand what type of reports, minutes and agendas he wanted. 
After some weeks of meeting with him we started to work out templates  for agendas, minutes and reports. 
After those first few weeks we started taking notes from every meeting we had.

\subsection{Communication}
We agreed early on to meet our supervisor once a week. 
Since our customer wanted to have a meeting with us on mondays we arranged it so we could meet our supervisor the as well.
Since we were already working in a room we had reserved in the library every monday we invited the supervisor to come meet us in this room.
Mostly every monday we had a meeting with our supervisor to discuss the progress.
He looked over what we had done and what we planned to do next week.
The he gave us the feedback he felt was needed.
 


\section{Suggestions for course improvements}
In all courses there are opportuneties for improvement.
In this section we will discuss what we thought could be better, clearer and more efficient.

Firstly, we as a group felt that there was a lot of information we didn't get from the start. 
The first day of the course was the day we meet the client and our group members had not prepared for this.
The first couple of weeks there was a lack of information about what was expected and what was to be delivered.
We had to figure out a lot along the way.

This project would definitivly improve with having more group members. 
We ended up beeing only three people while this project was really ment for a total of five people.
That left us with a lot of tasks and a lot of extra work to do.
Especially writing the report and developing the project would be a lot better with more members and work hours. 
We are pleased with the result of our project but it had potentionl to be a lot better with more hours of work whitch would only come from more group members. 

There were also some lectures throughout the semester. The times of these lectures were put at random times and not in the specified course time slots.
This lead to a lot of conflicts between course.
We advice that the course leaders try their best to plan lectures in the appointed timeslots so this wont happend future yers. 

We were early in reserving rooms for this course so we were maybe lucky in getting a room that we could work in this semester. Maybe other groups were not a lucky. 
The reserving of the rooms took some time for us to fix. 
It would be better for us to get a room apointed to our group that we could work in every week.
