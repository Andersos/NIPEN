\section{Front-end}

The main functionality of the front-end is to visualize the data stored by the Integration Platform.
This is accomplished by using a regular web-page consisting of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. HTML and CSS is used for structuring and giving a nice design of the web page. With help of JavaScript we are able to make the page dynamic.

\textbf{Design and Visualization}

One of the requirements given by the customer was that the front-end should use Helsenorge color palette. That is the front-end should use the colors shown in figure \ref{figure:helsenorge-color-palette}.
