\section{Suggestions for course improvements}
In all courses there are opportuneties for improvement.
In this section we will discuss what we thought could be better, clearer and more efficient.

Firstly, we as a group felt that there was a lot of information we didn't get from the start. 
The first day of the course was the day we meet the client and our group members had not prepared for this.
The first couple of weeks there was a lack of information about what was expected and what was to be delivered.
We had to figure out a lot along the way.

This project would definitivly improve with having more group members. 
We ended up beeing only three people while this project was really ment for atleast five people.
That left us with a lot of tasks and a lot of extra work to do.
Especially writing the report and developing the project would be a lot better with more members and work hours. 
We are pleased with the result of our project but it had potentionl to be a lot better with more hours of work whitch would only come from more group members. 

There were also some lectures throughout the semester. 
The times of these lectures were put at random times and not in the specified course time slots.
This lead to a lot of conflicts between course.
We advice that the course leaders try their best to plan lectures in the appointed timeslots so this won't happend future years. 

We were early in reserving rooms for this course so we were maybe lucky in getting a room that we could work in this semester. 
Maybe other groups were not as lucky. 
The reserving of the rooms took some time for us to fix. 
It would be better for us to get a room apointed to our group that we could work in every week.
