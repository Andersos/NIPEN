\section{Project description}

The purpose of the project is to design, develop and document an integration platform for citizen health care.
The intention of such platform is to allow citizens to publish information regarding their health produced by devices in their possession like mobile phones and tablets, as well as fetching such data into third party solutions.

The name we chose for the project is \textbf{NIPEN}. It is simply an acronym for \textbf{N}ational \textbf{I}ntegration \textbf{P}latform for \textbf{e}Health in \textbf{N}orway.

\section{Project background}

This project is part of the Customer Drivent Project (TDT4290) at NTNU.
Digital healthcare is about using information technologies to provide solutions to problems in healthcare. This definition includes a lot of different domains among which is eHealth. eHealth is
\begin{quote}
an emerging field in the intersection of medical informatics, public health and business, referring to health services and information delivered or enhanced through the Internet and related technologies.\citep{ehealth}
\end{quote}
eHealth projects are therefore long, complex and inherently costly. At the same time the progress in information technology has made available powerful and yet cheap devices which can be used to monitor health. These devices are nowdays widespread and used by a large part of the population.




\section{Problem domain}




\section{Project objective}

The goal of the customer is to investigate the possibilities for national eHealth's projects to leverage the dynamics of the market.

The purpose of the course is to let students acquire practical experience in development of a medium-large software project,
including experience in project management, group dynamics and customer relations.

\section{Duration}

The project began on the 21st of October 2013.
The project deadline is set for November the 22nd.

That makes a total of 13 weeks. Since we were advised to work 24 hours per week (each), we estimated a total of 13 * 3 * 24 = 936 working hours.
