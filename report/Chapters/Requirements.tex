\lhead{Chapter 4. \emph{Requirements specification}}

This chapter describes the requirements for the product. These include both functional and non-functional requirements.
Functional requirements can be found in section \ref{section:functionalreq},
non-functional requirements in section \ref{section:nonfunctionalreq}.

Throughout this chapter both requirement's priority and complexity have a textual description which can be
\begin{itemize}
\item High
\item Medium (abbr. Med)
\item Low
\end{itemize}

The use of such terms is described in table \ref{table:priorities} (priorities) and table \ref{table:complexity} (complexity).

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | c | p{12.5cm} | }
  \hline
  Priority & Description \\
  \hline\noalign{\smallskip}\noalign{\smallskip}\hline
  High & An essential requirement. The product \textbf{must fulfill} the requirement in order to be satisfactory. \\
  Medium & A useful requirement. The product \textbf{should fulfill} the requirement to maximise effectiveness. \\
  Low & A desiderabe requirement. The product \textbf{could fulfill} the requirement to be more interesting for certain stakeholders. \\

  Medium & The requirement is moderately difficult. It will take some time. (from 10 to 30 hours?) \\
  Low & The requirement is easy and can be achieved in a short amount of time. (10h or less?) \\

\section{Funcional requirements}
\label{section:functionalreq}

This section describes the functional requirements for the product.
Each requirements has a priority which helps us identify the focus of our work.
Priorities can be reviewed based on customer's feedback. We tried to prioritize those requirements corresponding to the functionality of the system that the customer expressed most interest about. In order to better organize our workload we also assigned a \'difficulty\' to each requirement.

\textbf{Functional requirements for Integration platform}

  FIP1	& The IP shall support REST endpoints for receiving heart rate data models expressed as JSON strings	& Med	& High \\
  FIP2	& The IP shall support REST endpoints for receiving weight data models expressed as JSON strings 		& High	& High \\
  FIP3	& The IP shall support REST endpoints for forwarding heart rate models (using JSON) to other systems.	& Med	& High \\

\section{Non-funcional requirements}
\label{section:nonfunctionalreq}

This section outlines non-functional requirements (quality attributes) for the product.
In order to provide a better overview, we have organized them in categories.

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | c | c |p{6.5cm} | c | c |}
  \hline
  ID & Category & Description & Difficulty & Priority\\
  \hline\noalign{\smallskip}\noalign{\smallskip}\hline
  NF1 & Documentation & The system shall be thoroughly documented, both at the code level and by the document ‘project report’.
  & High & High \\
  NF2 & Documentation & Although security and privacy are not requirements for the product they are important topics to be discussed in the documentation.
  & Med & High \\
  NF3 & Open-source	& The product shall be released under a permissive license approved by the product owner.
  & Low & High \\
  NF4 & Interoperability & The system shall provide a good degree of interoperability. Third party application developers should be put in the condition to develop third party (interoperable) solutions rapidly.
  & Med & High \\
  NF5 & Interoperability & A number of two-three prototype applications shall be developed in order to showcase the functionality of the system.
  & Med & High \\
  NF6 & Accessibility & The web-frontend should have a good degree of accessibility. It should have a rather simple design and use a user-provided palette.
  & Low & Low \\

\section{Requirements Validation}
(Sommerville 7.3)
How to ensure that a Requirements Document does define 
the customers’ requirements (check against desirable 
features)
• Comprehensibility - do customers understand the 
requirements?
• Verifiability (testability) - can requirements be 
realistically tested? If you cannot test it, it is not a 
requirement!
• Traceability - source of the requirement? Important 
when making changes.
• Adaptability (changeability) - what is the impact of 
changing a particular requirement?
