\section{Stakeholders}

In this section we are going to go through the stakeholders of our project.

\subsection{Customer}

The customer 

\subsection{Course evaluators}

\subsection{Developers}
implementer, designer, tester

\subsection{Users}
end user

\section{Funcional requirements}
This section describes the functional requirements for the product.
Each requirements has a priority which helps us identify the focus of our work.
Priorities can be reviewed based on customer's feedback. We tried to prioritize those requirements corresponding to the functionality of the system that the customer expressed most interest about. In order to better organize our workload we also assigned a \'difficulty\' to each requirement.

\textbf{Functional Requirements for Integration platform}

\begin{table}[h]

\begin{tabular}{ | c | p{9cm} | c | c |}
  \hline
  ID & Description & Difficulty & Priority\\
  \hline\noalign{\smallskip}\noalign{\smallskip}\hline
  FIP1	& The IP shall support REST endpoints for receiving heart rate data models.								& Med	& High \\
  FIP2	& The IP shall support REST endpoints for receiving weight data model.									& High	& High \\
  FIP3	& The IP shall support REST endpoints for forwarding heart rate data (using JSON) to other systems.		& Med	& High \\
  FPI4	& The IP shall support REST endpoints for forwarding weight data it has previously received.			& Med	& High \\

\section{Non-funcional requirements}

This section describes non-functional requirements for the project.
In order to give a better overview, we have organized them in categories.

\begin{table}[h]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ | c | c |p{6.5cm} | c | c |}
  \hline
  ID & Category & Description & Difficulty & Priority\\
  \hline\noalign{\smallskip}\noalign{\smallskip}\hline
  NF1 & Documentation & The system shall be thoroughly documented, both at the code level and by the document ‘project report’.
  & High & High \\
  NF2 & Documentation & Although security and privacy are not requirements for the product they are important topics to be discussed in the documentation.
  & Med & High \\
  NF3 & Open-source	& The product shall be released under a permissive license approved by the product owner.
  & Low & High \\
  NF4 & Interoperability & The system shall provide a good degree of interoperability. Third party application developers should be put in the condition to develop third party (interoperable) solutions rapidly.
  & Med & High \\
  NF5 & Interoperability & A number of two-three prototype applications shall be developed in order to showcase the functionality of the system.
  & Med & High \\
  NF6 & Accessibility & The web-frontend should have a good degree of accessibility. It should have a rather simple design and use a user-provided palette.
  & Low & Low \\
