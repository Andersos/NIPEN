\lhead{Chapter 8. \emph{Sprint 2}}

\section{Goal(s)}
Having just demonstrated the product to the customer in the previous sprint the main goal
for this iteration was to write the report in view of the deadline for mid-term delivery.
Additionally we had to assess the feasibility of the interoperability of our system with HealthVault.


\section{Planning}
Most of the work planned for this sprint was documentation writing.
This included writing the report itself but also reviewing other documents such as the templates, notes and agendas.

This plan made it easy to assign working tasks despite the fact that one member
of the team was working on the project remotely from another city.

Report work for this sprint was in fact something that we could


We also planned to begin some preliminary work toward the second prototype of the system which would
feature HealthVault interoperability. Our plan was to develop an Android application which would connect
to HealtVault in order to retrieve data about user's weight and forward it to our system. For this task
we planned to use HealthVault's SDK for Android.


\section{Duration}
\begin{itemize}
\item Start: September, 23rd
\item End: October, 6th
\end{itemize}

\section{Backlog}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Project management}\newline
	This included:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Weekly startup meeting}:
		\item \textbf{Meeting notes}:
			taking notes during meetings, reviewing of the notes.
		\item \textbf{Status reports}:
			for both week 39 and 40
		\item \textbf{Review templates}:
			we produced some templates to be adopted for status reports and other documents.
		\item \textbf{Risk analysis}:
			updated on a weekly basis, so twice per sprint.
			The risk analisys was submitted to the supervisor and the customer.
		\item \textbf{Planning for the next iteration}:
			the project manager prepared a plan for the next iteration
			which would be illustrated and agreed upon on next iteration's startup meeting.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Weekly meetings}
		included meetings with both the customer and the supervisor.
		*During week 39.we were unable to contact the customer. This was not a problem*
	\item \textbf{Report work}:
		we started writing the report.
		This tasks was definitely the biggest of the sprint and accounted for the majority of the work.
		We focused on writing the abstract and first chapters required for the mid-term delivery.
	\item \textbf{HealthVault studies}:
		we performed further studies in order to assess the feasibility of developing a prototype
		application that implemented interoperability with Microsoft's HealthVault platform.
	\item \textbf{System development}:
		this included some preliminary work on the backend to accomodate for the new weight API.
	\item \textbf{Application development}:
		Initial design and implementation of an Android application using the weight API.

\section{Results and feedback}

Results for this sprint are positive. We managed to write the initial chapters of the report.
Also, studies on HealtVault went smoothly and we had a good start at developing the Android application
especially. In fact, using HealthVault's SDK greatly reduced the amount of code we needed to write ourselves
from scratch.
System development also proceeded smoothly and we added support
