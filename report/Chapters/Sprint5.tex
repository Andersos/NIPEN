This sprint was a bit longer than the others because it included the last days
that were left till the end project.

\section{Planning}

The plan for this sprint consisted primarily in report writing and review.
At the beginning of the sprint we agreed with the supervisor to deliver him a mostly
finished version of the report by the end of the first week in order to let him
give us some last feedback on it.
